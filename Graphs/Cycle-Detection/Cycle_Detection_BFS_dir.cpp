/**
 * Cycle Detection using BFS on Directed graph is done by 👷 Reverse Engineering the Topological sort.(Khan's Algorithm)
 *
 * Topological Sort : is only applicable to the 🗿️ DAG's i.e Directed Acyclic Graphs .... so if we can apply Topo. the the graph is DAG so it does not have cycle
 * and if topological sort is not applicable then graph must be cyclic!
